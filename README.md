# Toy Project 1 : ☕ CafeRecommender for You
<p>
I started this to practice what I learned(HTML, CSS, JS) long time ago. <br>
But I turned my mind to become a Backend Developer and I'm still learning JAVA-JDBC(now here)-JSP-SPRING.<br>
I think this service is quite useful for some people who are looking for cafes to study.<br>
I'll finish this project after I learned how to distribute!<br>
Wait for me!! 😏
</p>

<p>
원래 HTML, CSS, Javascript 공부하기 위해 끄적끄적해보기 위해 생성된 레포지토리지만, <br>
아이디어는 괜찮다고 생각해서 살려둔다... (프로카공러들에게 엄청난 수요가 있을 거라고 생각함!!) <br>
Spring 배운 후 꼭 다시 돌아와서 완성할 것!! : 😤
